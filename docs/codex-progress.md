# Codex Progress Log

This file is a **living log** of what Codex (and/or human developers) have
implemented in this repository.

At the start of each coding session, Codex should:

1. Read this file completely.
2. Read `docs/codex-plan.md`.
3. Decide which phase and tasks to work on next.
4. Append notes under the relevant phase.

Use simple markdown checklists and timestamps where helpful.
